/** Topic: Window functions.

A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row.
This is comparable to the type of calculation that can be done with an aggregate function.
But unlike regular aggregate functions, use of a window function does not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row â€” the rows retain their separate identities.
Behind the scenes, the window function is able to access more than just the current row of the query result.

A window function call always contains an OVER clause directly following the window function's name and argument(s).
The OVER clause determines exactly how the rows of the query are split up for processing by the window function.

The PARTITION BY list within OVER specifies dividing the rows into groups, or partitions, that share the same values of the PARTITION BY expression(s).

There is another important concept associated with window functions: for each row, there is a set of rows within its partition called its window frame.
Many (but not all) window functions act only on the rows of the window frame, rather than of the whole partition.
By default, if ORDER BY is supplied then the frame consists of all rows from the start of the partition up through the current row, plus any following rows that are equal to the current row according to the ORDER BY clause.
When ORDER BY is omitted the default frame consists of all rows in the partition.

-- * One with the amount being added for each row,
-- * one for the truncated date,
-- * and a final column with the running total within each year.

/** Topics: ROW_NUMBER and RANK
The RANK() function produces a numerical rank within the current row's partition for each distinct ORDER BY value, in the order defined by the ORDER BY clause.
RANK needs no explicit parameter, because its behavior is entirely determined by the OVER clause.

row_number() -> Returns the number of the current row within its partition, counting from 1.

dense_rank() -> Returns the rank of the current row, without gaps; this function effectively counts peer groups.
