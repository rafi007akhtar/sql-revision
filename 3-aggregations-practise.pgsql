-- NOTE: in many the statements below, I am limiting only cause the # rows are too many.

/**
JOINs are used for row-level data, and aggregates for column-level.
In practice, row-level data can only be so useful. As the dataset becomes more familiar, aggregates will be performed more often than joins.
Reason: Joins give you many rows of data, while aggregates summarize the data in a single line.

/** Topic: NULLs
NULLs are a datatype that specifies where no data exists in SQL.
They are often ignored in our aggregation functions, which you will get a first look at in the next concept using COUNT.

Reason: NULL is not a value. It is a property of the data.
For the same reason, it will not work with !. It will only work with NOT.

It counts the number of rows in the query that have at least one non-NULL value.
In most cases, it is equal to the number of rows in the query.

SUM can only work on numeric columns.
It will add all the non-NULL cells in the column, and ignore the NULLs.

/** Topic: MIN, MAX, AVG
Functionally, MIN and MAX are similar to COUNT in that they can be used on non-numerical columns.
Depending on the column type, MIN will return the lowest number, earliest date, or non-numerical value as early in the alphabet as possible.
As you might suspect, MAX does the oppositeâ€”it returns the highest number, the latest date, or the non-numerical value closest alphabetically to "Z."

Similar to other software AVG returns the mean of the data
- that is the sum of all of the values in the column divided by the number of values in a column.
This aggregate function again ignores the NULL values in both the numerator and the denominator.

AVG(item) exlcudes NULL from both numberator and denominator.
If NULL rows are also to be included, the expression should be
SUM(item)/COUNT(item)
