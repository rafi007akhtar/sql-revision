/**
JOINs are used for row-level data, and aggregates for column-level.
In practice, row-level data can only be so useful. As the dataset becomes more familiar, aggregates will be performed more often than joins.
Reason: Joins give you many rows of data, while aggregates summarize the data in a single line.

As you might suspect, MAX does the oppositeâ€”it returns the highest number, the latest date, or the non-numerical value closest alphabetically to "Z."
