/**
JOINs are used for row-level data, and aggregates for column-level.
In practice, row-level data can only be so useful. As the dataset becomes more familiar, aggregates will be performed more often than joins.
Reason: Joins give you many rows of data, while aggregates summarize the data in a single line.

NULLs are a datatype that specifies where no data exists in SQL.

Functionally, MIN and MAX are similar to COUNT in that they can be used on non-numerical columns.
Depending on the column type, MIN will return the lowest number, earliest date, or non-numerical value as early in the alphabet as possible.
As you might suspect, MAX does the oppositeâ€”it returns the highest number, the latest date, or the non-numerical value closest alphabetically to "Z."

Similar to other software AVG returns the mean of the data
- that is the sum of all of the values in the column divided by the number of values in a column.
This aggregate function again ignores the NULL values in both the numerator and the denominator.

GROUP BY can be used to aggregate data within subsets of the data.
For example, grouping for different accounts, different regions, or different sales representatives.
GROUP BY goes b/w WHERE and ORDER BY.

Rule of thumb: Any column in a SELECT statement not being aggregated should be in the GROUP BY if the statement contains aggregations.
