-- NOTE: in many the statements below, I am limiting only cause the # rows are too many.

/**
JOINs are used for row-level data, and aggregates for column-level.
In practice, row-level data can only be so useful. As the dataset becomes more familiar, aggregates will be performed more often than joins.
Reason: Joins give you many rows of data, while aggregates summarize the data in a single line.

/** Topic: NULLs
NULLs are a datatype that specifies where no data exists in SQL.
They are often ignored in our aggregation functions, which you will get a first look at in the next concept using COUNT.

/** Topic: MIN, MAX, AVG
Functionally, MIN and MAX are similar to COUNT in that they can be used on non-numerical columns.
Depending on the column type, MIN will return the lowest number, earliest date, or non-numerical value as early in the alphabet as possible.
As you might suspect, MAX does the oppositeâ€”it returns the highest number, the latest date, or the non-numerical value closest alphabetically to "Z."

Similar to other software AVG returns the mean of the data
- that is the sum of all of the values in the column divided by the number of values in a column.
This aggregate function again ignores the NULL values in both the numerator and the denominator.

/** Topic: GROUP BY
GROUP BY can be used to aggregate data within subsets of the data.
For example, grouping for different accounts, different regions, or different sales representatives.
GROUP BY goes b/w WHERE and ORDER BY.

Note: SQL evaluates the aggregations before the LIMIT clause.

Rule of thumb: Any column in a SELECT statement not being aggregated should be in the GROUP BY if the statement contains aggregations.
